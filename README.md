A collection of Jupyter Notebooks covering key machine learning algorithms, with explanations and Python implementations.

### Introduction 
This repository was born from the notes I took while learning basic machine learning algorithms. It is designed for those who are beginning their journey in machine learning and want to see actual implementations of these models.

The explanations are kept concise, focusing on key concepts that I found essential while learning. The goal is to provide clear, practical examples of how these algorithms are implemented in Python

### Topics covered
* Linear & Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees & Random Forests
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
* Ensemble Learning 

### How to Use 
1.  Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

3.   Open a Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

4.  Run the code and modify it to experiment!
### Requirements â€“ If applicable, list dependencies (e.g., NumPy, scikit-learn).
